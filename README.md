This code base is the open source code base of Article 'The effect of vacancy defects on the stability of atomic metallic hydrogen: A deep neural network molecular dynamics study'. 
There is also a large amount of simulated structure data in the open source database at 'https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.17800026'. 
Copying the simulated structure data to the folder 'Stability_temperature-pressure_ranges' can run smoothly.
